__This is a work in-progress__

**Yet another dashboard to archive and visualize data collected from the Tesla owner API.** 


The TypeScript types for server and UI are provided by [tesla-dashboard-api](https://github.com/jchull/tesla-dashboard-api).
The backend is provided by [tesla-dashboard-server](https://github.com/jchull/tesla-dashboard-server).

Just getting started on this, and refreshing my React skills, learning the power of TypeScript, 
and getting more-comfortable with D3. The plan is to have an easy-to-use 
dashboard that can display the most-common charts and statistics.  

Here is some charging data at a V2 Supercharger.
